Corby CJ-1 Starlet for X-Plane 11, by FTLX Designs

The Corby CJ-1 Starlet is a single seat, amateur-built aeroplane designed in the 1960s by Australian aeronautical engineer John Corby. 

The structure is primarily wood and fabric. The prototype first flew in 1967, and is a popular design built by enthusiasts in many countries. A variety of engine types have been used, ranging from 60 to 80 brake horsepower (60 kW). It is an agile sportsplane with either an open cockpit and perspex windshield, or a bubble canopy, giving the pilot a "fighter-like" flying experience.

Specifications (typical):

Crew: one pilot
Length: 4.5 m (14 ft 9 in)
Wingspan: 5.72 m (18 ft 6 in)
Wing area: 6.4 m2 (69 sq ft)
Empty weight: 204 kg (450 lb)
Gross weight: 340 kg (750 lb)
Powerplant: 1 × Volkswagen air-cooled engine or Jabiru 2200 , 52–64 kW (70–85 hp)

Performance
Maximum speed: 260 km/h (160 mph, 140 kn)
Range: 685 km (425 mi, 369 nm)
Rate of climb: 5.6 m/s (1,100 ft/min)

Notes:
While the Starlet is not approved for aerobatics everywhere, it is a ton of fun!  I attempted to model the 1835 VW engine producing about 65hp (60 continuous), seems to be enough without going over the top (it turns counter-clockwise so left rudder is needed at higher power settings).  The roll rate is more than acceptable and the light weight of the airframe will enable you some pretty fun maneuvers. Be very mindful of your airspeed though, particularly on approach and flare; the 43-series airfoils have a sharp and sudden stall (around 45pmh or so).  I would love to get feedback from someone who has flown this IRL, it would be super helpful for additional flight model improvements.

To start the engine, click on the battery and mags first, then click the prop.  As usual with taildraggers, mind your taxi speed, although the Starlet has a decent track so its relatively stable.  Rotation is around 45-50 (airspeed is in MPH), climb is roughly 75-80 for a decent rate based on my experience.  Approach is around 60-70 and landing should be between 50-60 or so depending on weight.
